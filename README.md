# Go-Go-Gecko

## Description

This game is a spin off of the classic browser game T-Rex run. It is a game where you have have to avoid the obstacles coming at you by jumping over them. I decided to make it about a Gecko because I used to bread Reptiles and Amphibians and it was something I really enjoyed!

# Screen shots

 Below are screen shots of the games development from its wireframe to the complete game.
 
 Step 1. Build the wire-frame

Step 2. Build the wireframe using HTML and CSS.

# Technologies Used: 

To build this I used: Java Script, CSS & HTML 

I used HTML to build the bones of the game, i.e the reset button, div containers, images & header tag. These were all assigned classes so that they could be called later in the project. 

I then used CSS to style and animate the game. The character and object started out as little blue and grey boxes on the screen. They would change colors as they jumped or moved across the screen. This helped in visualizing what the object and character where doing at different stages of the animation.

I then used JavaScript to handle the functionality side of the game. I started out by creating my variables and using DOM manipulation to access the classes I had assigned earlier in the project. I then moved on to the functions and eventListeners. This gave me the ability to add a jump feature, a way for the game to know if the two objects had hit eachother and then assigning my movement to the spacebar. 



# Getting Started:

How to play the game: The game is controlled by using the spacebar to jump over the cactus. If are successful in clearing the cactus that counts as one point. If you hit the cactus it will result in a game over. To play again just click the reset button.

# Next Steps:

I would like to add multiple objects to jump over. I would also like to be able to move the gecko forward and backwards on the screen. I would then like to add music and sound effects to the game.
