# Go-Go-Gecko

## Description
This game is a spin off of the classic browser game T-Rex run. It is a simple game where you have have to avoid the objects coming at you by jumping over them. I decided to make it about a Gecko because I used to breading Reptiles and Amphibians and it was something I really enjoyed!

# Technologies Used: 
To build this I used: Java Script, CSS & HTML 

# Getting Started:
To play the game you use the space bar and jump over the cactus. If you get game over just hit reset and the game will start back at the beginning.

# Next Steps:
I would like to add multiple objects to jump over. I would also like to be able to move the gecko forward and backwards on the screen. I would then like to add music and sound effects to the game.
